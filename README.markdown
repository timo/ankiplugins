timo/ankiplugins
================

This repository contains plugins I created for anki, the friendly, intelligent spaced learning system.

epwing.py
---------

This script comes from the ankiwiki and is just an example plugin. See [the anki wiki](http://www.ichi2.net/anki/wiki/Plugins#head-783bd2a73e3e4cd517f50ba4395ef6432411e526).

sortSuspend.py
--------------

This script will turn your "Current -> Suspend" menu into a submenu listing all tags that are currently suspended, so that you can "sort" cards into groups that you might want to re-activate later.

Installation
============

Installation - as with all anki plugins - is simple as pie: Just copy them into the plugin folder (~/.anki/plugins on linux - use 'anki' -> 'plugins' -> 'open plugin folder' to see it on all systems)
